Claude Code has access to a set of tools that help it understand and modify your codebase. The tool names below are the exact strings you use in [permission rules](</docs/en/permissions#tool-specific-permission-rules>), [subagent tool lists](</docs/en/sub-agents>), and [hook matchers](</docs/en/hooks>).

Tool| Description| Permission Required
---|---|---
`Agent`| Spawns a [subagent](</docs/en/sub-agents>) with its own context window to handle a task| No
`AskUserQuestion`| Asks multiple-choice questions to gather requirements or clarify ambiguity| No
`Bash`| Executes shell commands in your environment. See Bash tool behavior| Yes
`CronCreate`| Schedules a recurring or one-shot prompt within the current session (gone when Claude exits). See [scheduled tasks](</docs/en/scheduled-tasks>)| No
`CronDelete`| Cancels a scheduled task by ID| No
`CronList`| Lists all scheduled tasks in the session| No
`Edit`| Makes targeted edits to specific files| Yes
`EnterPlanMode`| Switches to plan mode to design an approach before coding| No
`EnterWorktree`| Creates an isolated [git worktree](</docs/en/common-workflows#run-parallel-claude-code-sessions-with-git-worktrees>) and switches into it| No
`ExitPlanMode`| Presents a plan for approval and exits plan mode| Yes
`ExitWorktree`| Exits a worktree session and returns to the original directory| No
`Glob`| Finds files based on pattern matching| No
`Grep`| Searches for patterns in file contents| No
`ListMcpResourcesTool`| Lists resources exposed by connected [MCP servers](</docs/en/mcp>)| No
`LSP`| Code intelligence via language servers. Reports type errors and warnings automatically after file edits. Also supports navigation operations: jump to definitions, find references, get type info, list symbols, find implementations, trace call hierarchies. Requires a [code intelligence plugin](</docs/en/discover-plugins#code-intelligence>) and its language server binary| No
`NotebookEdit`| Modifies Jupyter notebook cells| Yes
`Read`| Reads the contents of files| No
`ReadMcpResourceTool`| Reads a specific MCP resource by URI| No
`Skill`| Executes a [skill](</docs/en/skills#control-who-invokes-a-skill>) within the main conversation| Yes
`TaskCreate`| Creates a new task in the task list| No
`TaskGet`| Retrieves full details for a specific task| No
`TaskList`| Lists all tasks with their current status| No
`TaskOutput`| Retrieves output from a background task| No
`TaskStop`| Kills a running background task by ID| No
`TaskUpdate`| Updates task status, dependencies, details, or deletes tasks| No
`TodoWrite`| Manages the session task checklist. Available in non-interactive mode and the [Agent SDK](</docs/en/headless>); interactive sessions use TaskCreate, TaskGet, TaskList, and TaskUpdate instead| No
`ToolSearch`| Searches for and loads deferred tools when [tool search](</docs/en/mcp#scale-with-mcp-tool-search>) is enabled| No
`WebFetch`| Fetches content from a specified URL| Yes
`WebSearch`| Performs web searches| Yes
`Write`| Creates or overwrites files| Yes

Permission rules can be configured using `/permissions` or in [permission settings](</docs/en/settings#available-settings>). Also see [Tool-specific permission rules](</docs/en/permissions#tool-specific-permission-rules>).

Bash tool behavior

The Bash tool runs each command in a separate process with the following persistence behavior:

  * Working directory persists across commands. Set `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1` to reset to the project directory after each command.
  * Environment variables do not persist. An `export` in one command will not be available in the next.

Activate your virtualenv or conda environment before launching Claude Code. To make environment variables persist across Bash commands, set [`CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`](</docs/en/env-vars>) to a shell script before launching Claude Code, or use a [SessionStart hook](</docs/en/hooks#persist-environment-variables>) to populate it dynamically.
