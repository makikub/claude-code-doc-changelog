Claude Code supports multiple authentication methods depending on your setup. Individual users can log in with a Claude.ai account, while teams can use Claude for Teams or Enterprise, the Claude Console, or a cloud provider like Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry.

##

​

Log in to Claude Code

After [installing Claude Code](</docs/en/setup#install-claude-code>), run `claude` in your terminal. On first launch, Claude Code opens a browser window for you to log in. If the browser doesn’t open automatically, press `c` to copy the login URL to your clipboard, then paste it into your browser. You can authenticate with any of these account types:

  * **Claude Pro or Max subscription** : log in with your Claude.ai account. Subscribe at [claude.com/pricing](<https://claude.com/pricing?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=authentication_pro_max>).
  * **Claude for Teams or Enterprise** : log in with the Claude.ai account your team admin invited you to.
  * **Claude Console** : log in with your Console credentials. Your admin must have invited you first.
  * **Cloud providers** : if your organization uses [Amazon Bedrock](</docs/en/amazon-bedrock>), [Google Vertex AI](</docs/en/google-vertex-ai>), or [Microsoft Foundry](</docs/en/microsoft-foundry>), set the required environment variables before running `claude`. No browser login is needed.

To log out and re-authenticate, type `/logout` at the Claude Code prompt. If you’re having trouble logging in, see [authentication troubleshooting](</docs/en/troubleshooting#authentication-issues>).

Set up team authentication

For teams and organizations, you can configure Claude Code access in one of these ways:

  * Claude for Teams or Enterprise, recommended for most teams
  * Claude Console
  * [Amazon Bedrock](</docs/en/amazon-bedrock>)
  * [Google Vertex AI](</docs/en/google-vertex-ai>)
  * [Microsoft Foundry](</docs/en/microsoft-foundry>)

Claude for Teams or Enterprise

[Claude for Teams](<https://claude.com/pricing?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=authentication_teams#team-&-enterprise>) and [Claude for Enterprise](<https://anthropic.com/contact-sales?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=authentication_enterprise>) provide the best experience for organizations using Claude Code. Team members get access to both Claude Code and Claude on the web with centralized billing and team management.

  * **Claude for Teams** : self-service plan with collaboration features, admin tools, and billing management. Best for smaller teams.
  * **Claude for Enterprise** : adds SSO, domain capture, role-based permissions, compliance API, and managed policy settings for organization-wide Claude Code configurations. Best for larger organizations with security and compliance requirements.

3

Install and log in

###

​

Claude Console authentication

For organizations that prefer API-based billing, you can set up access through the Claude Console.

1

Create or use a Console account

Use your existing Claude Console account or create a new one.

2

Add users

You can add users through either method:

  * Bulk invite users from within the Console: Settings -> Members -> Invite
  * [Set up SSO](<https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13132885-setting-up-single-sign-on-sso>)

3

Assign roles

When inviting users, assign one of:

  * **Claude Code** role: users can only create Claude Code API keys
  * **Developer** role: users can create any kind of API key

4

Users complete setup

Each invited user needs to:

  * Accept the Console invite
  * [Check system requirements](</docs/en/setup#system-requirements>)
  * [Install Claude Code](</docs/en/setup#install-claude-code>)
  * Log in with Console account credentials

###

​

Cloud provider authentication

For teams using Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry:

1

Follow provider setup

Follow the [Bedrock docs](</docs/en/amazon-bedrock>), [Vertex docs](</docs/en/google-vertex-ai>), or [Microsoft Foundry docs](</docs/en/microsoft-foundry>).

2

Distribute configuration

Distribute the environment variables and instructions for generating cloud credentials to your users. Read more about how to [manage configuration here](</docs/en/settings>).

3

Install Claude Code

Users can [install Claude Code](</docs/en/setup#install-claude-code>).

Credential management

Claude Code securely manages your authentication credentials:

  * **Storage location** : on macOS, credentials are stored in the encrypted macOS Keychain. On Linux and Windows, credentials are stored in `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, or under `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if that variable is set. On Linux, the file is written with mode `0600`; on Windows, it inherits the access controls of your user profile directory.
  * **Supported authentication types** : Claude.ai credentials, Claude API credentials, Azure Auth, Bedrock Auth, and Vertex Auth.
  * **Custom credential scripts** : the [`apiKeyHelper`](</docs/en/settings#available-settings>) setting can be configured to run a shell script that returns an API key.
  * **Refresh intervals** : by default, `apiKeyHelper` is called after 5 minutes or on HTTP 401 response. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_API_KEY_HELPER_TTL_MS` environment variable for custom refresh intervals.
  * **Slow helper notice** : if `apiKeyHelper` takes longer than 10 seconds to return a key, Claude Code displays a warning notice in the prompt bar showing the elapsed time. If you see this notice regularly, check whether your credential script can be optimized.

`apiKeyHelper`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` apply to terminal CLI sessions only. Claude Desktop and remote sessions use OAuth exclusively and do not call `apiKeyHelper` or read API key environment variables.

​

Authentication precedence

When multiple credentials are present, Claude Code chooses one in this order:

  1. Cloud provider credentials, when `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, or `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY` is set. See [third-party integrations](</docs/en/third-party-integrations>) for setup.
  2. `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. Sent as the `Authorization: Bearer` header. Use this when routing through an [LLM gateway or proxy](</docs/en/llm-gateway>) that authenticates with bearer tokens rather than Anthropic API keys.
  3. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. Sent as the `X-Api-Key` header. Use this for direct Anthropic API access with a key from the [Claude Console](<https://platform.claude.com>). In interactive mode, you are prompted once to approve or decline the key, and your choice is remembered. To change it later, use the “Use custom API key” toggle in `/config`. In non-interactive mode (`-p`), the key is always used when present.
  4. [`apiKeyHelper`](</docs/en/settings#available-settings>) script output. Use this for dynamic or rotating credentials, such as short-lived tokens fetched from a vault.
  5. Subscription OAuth credentials from `/login`. This is the default for Claude Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise users.

If you have an active Claude subscription but also have `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in your environment, the API key takes precedence once approved. This can cause authentication failures if the key belongs to a disabled or expired organization. Run `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to fall back to your subscription, and check `/status` to confirm which method is active. [Claude Code on the Web](</docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web>) always uses your subscription credentials. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` in the sandbox environment do not override them.
