[Subagents](</docs/en/sub-agents>), [agent view](</docs/en/agent-view>), [agent teams](</docs/en/agent-teams>), and [worktrees](</docs/en/worktrees>) each parallelize work in a different way. The right one depends on whether you want to stay in each conversation yourself, hand tasks off and check back later, or have Claude coordinate a group of workers for you.

Approach| What it gives you| Use it when
---|---|---
[Subagents](</docs/en/sub-agents>)| Delegated workers inside one session that do a side task in their own context and return a summary| A side task would flood your main conversation with search results, logs, or file contents you won’t reference again
[Agent view](</docs/en/agent-view>)| One screen to dispatch and monitor sessions running in the background, opened with `claude agents`. Research preview| You have several independent tasks and want to hand them off, check status at a glance, and step in only when one needs you
[Agent teams](</docs/en/agent-teams>)| Multiple coordinated sessions with a shared task list and inter-agent messaging, managed by a lead. Experimental and disabled by default| You want Claude to split a project into pieces, assign them, and keep the workers in sync
[Worktrees](</docs/en/worktrees>)| Separate git checkouts so parallel sessions never touch each other’s files| You’re running several sessions yourself, or your subagents edit overlapping files
[`/batch`](</docs/en/commands>)| A planned split of one large change into 5 to 30 worktree-isolated subagents that each open a pull request| A repo-wide migration or mechanical refactor you can describe in one instruction

In every approach the workers are Claude sessions. To involve a different tool, expose it to Claude as an [MCP server](</docs/en/mcp>). You can combine these approaches. Agent view automatically moves each dispatched session into its own worktree when it needs to edit files, and a session you’re working in can spawn subagents that each get their own worktree.

Running several sessions or subagents at once multiplies token usage. See [Costs](</docs/en/costs>) for usage and rate-limit details.

Choose an approach

The right approach depends on who coordinates the work, whether the workers need to communicate, and whether they edit the same files:

  * **Who coordinates the work?** If you want Claude to delegate and collect results inside one conversation, use [subagents](</docs/en/sub-agents>). If you’re handing off independent tasks and checking back on them, use [agent view](</docs/en/agent-view>). If you want Claude to plan, assign, and supervise a group of workers, use [agent teams](</docs/en/agent-teams>), which are experimental and disabled by default.
  * **Do the workers need to talk to each other?** Subagents report results back to the conversation that spawned them, and agent view sessions report only to you. Teammates in an agent team share a task list and message each other directly.
  * **Do the tasks touch the same files?** Isolate the work with [worktrees](</docs/en/worktrees>). Subagents and sessions you run yourself can each use a separate worktree. Agent teams don’t isolate teammates in worktrees, so [partition the work](</docs/en/agent-teams#avoid-file-conflicts>) so each teammate owns a different set of files.

Check on running work

The command for checking on running work depends on which approach you used:

  * For background sessions, `claude agents` opens [agent view](</docs/en/agent-view>): one screen showing every session, its state, and which ones need your input.
  * For subagents in the current session, `/agents` opens a panel with a **Running** tab listing live subagents and a **Library** tab where you [create and edit custom subagents](</docs/en/sub-agents#use-the-%2Fagents-command>). Despite the similar name, this is separate from `claude agents`.
  * For anything running in the background of the current session, `/tasks` lists each item and lets you check on, attach to, or stop it.

For a desktop view of all your sessions, see [parallel sessions in the desktop app](</docs/en/desktop#work-in-parallel-with-sessions>).

Each guide below covers setup and configuration for one approach:

  * [Create custom subagents](</docs/en/sub-agents>): define reusable specialists and control which tools they can use.
  * [Manage agents with agent view](</docs/en/agent-view>): dispatch sessions, watch their state, and attach when one needs you.
  * [Orchestrate agent teams](</docs/en/agent-teams>): set up a lead and teammates, assign tasks, and review their work.
  * [Run parallel sessions with worktrees](</docs/en/worktrees>): start Claude in an isolated checkout, control what gets copied in, and clean up afterward.
