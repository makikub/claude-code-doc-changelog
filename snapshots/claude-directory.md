Claude Code reads instructions, settings, skills, subagents, and memory from your project directory and from `~/.claude` in your home directory. Commit project files to git to share them with your team; files in `~/.claude` are personal configuration that applies across all your projects. On Windows, `~/.claude` resolves to `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`. If you set [`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`](</docs/en/env-vars>), every `~/.claude` path on this page lives under that directory instead. Most users only edit `CLAUDE.md` and `settings.json`. The rest of the directory is optional: add skills, rules, or subagents as you need them.

What’s not shown

The explorer covers files you author and edit. A few related files live elsewhere:

File| Location| Purpose
---|---|---
`managed-settings.json`| System-level, varies by OS| Enterprise-enforced settings that you can’t override. See [server-managed settings](</docs/en/server-managed-settings>).
`CLAUDE.local.md`| Project root| Your private preferences for this project, loaded alongside CLAUDE.md. Create it manually and add it to `.gitignore`.
Installed plugins| `~/.claude/plugins`| Cloned marketplaces, installed plugin versions, and per-plugin data, managed by `claude plugin` commands. Orphaned versions are deleted 7 days after a plugin update or uninstall. See [plugin caching](</docs/en/plugins-reference#plugin-caching-and-file-resolution>).

`~/.claude` also holds data Claude Code writes as you work: transcripts, prompt history, file snapshots, caches, and logs. See application data below.

Choose the right file

Different kinds of customization live in different files. Use this table to find where a change belongs.

You want to| Edit| Scope| Reference

Allow or block specific tool calls| `settings.json` `permissions` or `hooks`| project or global| [Permissions](</docs/en/permissions>), [Hooks](</docs/en/hooks>)
Run a script before or after tool calls| `settings.json` `hooks`| project or global| [Hooks](</docs/en/hooks>)
Set environment variables for the session| `settings.json` `env`| project or global| [Settings](</docs/en/settings#available-settings>)

Add a prompt or capability you invoke with `/name`| `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`| project or global| [Skills](</docs/en/skills>)
Define a specialized subagent with its own tools| `agents/*.md`| project or global| [Subagents](</docs/en/sub-agents>)
Connect external tools over MCP| `.mcp.json`| project only| [MCP](</docs/en/mcp>)

File reference

This table lists every file the explorer covers. Project-scope files live in your repo under `.claude/` (or at the root for `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`, and `.worktreeinclude`). Global-scope files live in `~/.claude/` and apply across all projects.

Several things can override what you put in these files:

  * [Managed settings](</docs/en/server-managed-settings>) deployed by your organization take precedence over everything
  * CLI flags like `--permission-mode` or `--settings` override `settings.json` for that session
  * Some environment variables take precedence over their equivalent setting, but this varies: check the [environment variables reference](</docs/en/env-vars>) for each one

See [settings precedence](</docs/en/settings#settings-precedence>) for the full order.

Troubleshoot configuration

If a setting, hook, or file isn’t taking effect, see [Debug your configuration](</docs/en/debug-your-config>) for the inspection commands and a symptom-first lookup table.

Application data

Beyond the config you author, `~/.claude` holds data Claude Code writes during sessions. These files are plaintext. Anything that passes through a tool lands in a transcript on disk: file contents, command output, pasted text.

###

​

Cleaned up automatically

Files in the paths below are deleted on startup once they’re older than [`cleanupPeriodDays`](</docs/en/settings#available-settings>). The default is 30 days.

Path under `~/.claude/`| Contents
---|---
`projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl`| Full conversation transcript: every message, tool call, and tool result
`projects/<project>/<session>/tool-results/`| Large tool outputs spilled to separate files
`file-history/<session>/`| Pre-edit snapshots of files Claude changed, used for [checkpoint restore](</docs/en/checkpointing>)
`plans/`| Plan files written during [plan mode](</docs/en/permission-modes#analyze-before-you-edit-with-plan-mode>)
`debug/`| Per-session debug logs, written only when you start with `--debug` or run `/debug`
`paste-cache/`, `image-cache/`| Contents of large pastes and attached images
`session-env/`| Per-session environment metadata
`tasks/`| Per-session task lists written by the task tools
`shell-snapshots/`| Captured shell environment used by the Bash tool. Removed on clean exit. The sweep clears any left after a crash.
`backups/`| Timestamped copies of `~/.claude.json` taken before config migrations

###

​

Kept until you delete them

The following paths are not covered by automatic cleanup and persist indefinitely.

Path under `~/.claude/`| Contents
---|---
`history.jsonl`| Every prompt you’ve typed, with timestamp and project path. Used for up-arrow recall.
`stats-cache.json`| Aggregated token and cost counts shown by `/usage`
`todos/`| Legacy per-session task lists. No longer written by current versions; safe to delete.

Other small cache and lock files appear depending on which features you use and are safe to delete.

###

​

Plaintext storage

Transcripts and history are not encrypted at rest. OS file permissions are the only protection. If a tool reads a `.env` file or a command prints a credential, that value is written to `projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl`. To reduce exposure:

  * Lower `cleanupPeriodDays` to shorten how long transcripts are kept
  * Set the [`CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_PROMPT_HISTORY`](</docs/en/env-vars>) environment variable to skip writing transcripts and prompt history in any mode. In non-interactive mode, you can instead pass `--no-session-persistence` alongside `-p`, or set `persistSession: false` in the Agent SDK.
  * Use [permission rules](</docs/en/permissions>) to deny reads of credential files

###

​

Clear local data

You can delete any of the application-data paths above at any time. New sessions are unaffected. The table below shows what you lose for past sessions.

Delete| You lose
---|---
`~/.claude/projects/`| Resume, continue, and rewind for past sessions
`~/.claude/history.jsonl`| Up-arrow prompt recall
`~/.claude/file-history/`| Checkpoint restore for past sessions
`~/.claude/stats-cache.json`| Historical totals shown by `/usage`
`~/.claude/debug/`, `~/.claude/plans/`, `~/.claude/paste-cache/`, `~/.claude/image-cache/`, `~/.claude/session-env/`, `~/.claude/tasks/`, `~/.claude/shell-snapshots/`, `~/.claude/backups/`| Nothing user-facing
`~/.claude/todos/`| Nothing. Legacy directory not written by current versions.

Don’t delete `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, or `~/.claude/plugins/`: those hold your auth, preferences, and installed plugins.
